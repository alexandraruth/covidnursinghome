### Description

This app was designed for a class project where the objective was to develop a Shiny app displaying outputs from a predictive model in a topic area of the student's choice. Inputs include:

+  ((fill in inputs))

And the outcome of interest is ((outcome)).

This app also provides detailed information on the origins of this particular dataset and caveats of using this dataset.

### Data

Data for this dashboard come from the [CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset](https://data.cms.gov/stories/s/COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Data/bkwz-xpvg/).

COVID data in long-term care facilities has been a devastating and complex story throughout the pandemic - another source of data for deaths and cases in nursing homes among both residents and staff can be found at the COVID Tracking Project webpage. This page also has excellent background information on how the datasets differ. For this project, the CMS data was used because it includes richer information about ongoing PPE and staffing shortages that were of interest for this question.  

### R packages
